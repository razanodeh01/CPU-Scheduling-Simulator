# 🖥️ CPU Scheduling Simulator (C)


## 📄 About the Project

A C-based simulator for CPU scheduling that supports multiple algorithms, including Round Robin, Priority (preemptive and non-preemptive), SJF, and SRTF. It calculates average waiting, turnaround, and response times for each algorithm and compares efficiency.


## 🧠 Supported Scheduling Algorithms

- First Come First Serve (FCFS).
- Round Robin (RR).
- Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive).
- Shortest Job First (SJF).
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF).



## 📊 Output Metrics

Each algorithm reports:
- Average Waiting Time.
- Average Turnaround Time.
- Average Response Time.

You can also compare which algorithm performs best in each metric.
