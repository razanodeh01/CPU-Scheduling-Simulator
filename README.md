# Operating System Simulator

## üìÉ Project Overview
This repository contains an operating system simulator designed to model CPU scheduling. It supports multiple scheduling algorithms including Round Robin, Priority (both preemptive and non-preemptive), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). The simulator allows configuration of scheduling parameters to simulate tasks and evaluate performance metrics like average waiting time, turnaround time, and response time.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Multiple Scheduling Algorithms:** Implements Round Robin, Priority (preemptive and non-preemptive), SJF, and SRTF.
- **Dynamic Scheduling:** Users can configure scheduling parameters such as quantum time for Round Robin and priority levels for processes.
- **Visualization Tools:** Includes Gantt charts to visually represent the scheduling process and results.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to manage incorrect inputs and system failures.
- **Extensive Documentation:** Detailed documentation for understanding system operations and usage.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started
